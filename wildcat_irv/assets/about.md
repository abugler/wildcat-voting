### Hi! Welcome to Wildcat Voting!

I'm Andreas Bugler, and I developed this app with the help of Nathan White.

The purpose of Wildcat Voting is to facilitate Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) Elections being run on
[Wildcat Connection](https://northwestern.campuslabs.com/engage/). The default voting mechanism our society uses
(First-past-the-post) is simple to perform on a spreadsheet or on paper. However, more complex systems that attempt
to fix the inherent problems in First-past-the-post are more involved to compute.

[What is IRV?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting)
